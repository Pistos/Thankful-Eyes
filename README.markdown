# Thankful Eyes

## About

Thankful Eyes is a bookmarklet which automatically calculates and applies a
large enough font size to body text for optimum readability.

## Installation

Copy the whole contents of bookmarklet.js (including the "javascript:" part at
the beginning) and paste into the Address/Location/URL field when creating a
new bookmark in your browser.  For convenience, also put the bookmarklet on a
toolbar.

## Usage

Click your bookmarklet button on any page that has illegibly small body text.

## Notes

You can adjust two variables at the top of the script to control its behaviour.

Thankful Eyes is developed on and for Opera. However, it works as-is on
Firefox, too.
