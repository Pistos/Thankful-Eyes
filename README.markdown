# Thankful Eyes

## About

Thankful Eyes is a bookmarklet which automatically calculates and applies a
large enough font size to body text for optimum readability.

## Installation

Copy the whole contents of bookmarklet.js (including the "javascript:" part at
the beginning) and paste into the Address/Location/URL field when creating a
new bookmark in your browser.  For convenience, also put the bookmarklet on a
toolbar.

## Usage

Click your bookmarklet button on any page that has illegibly small body text.

## Notes

You can adjust two variables at the top of the script to control its behaviour.

Thankful Eyes is developed on and for Opera. However, it works as-is on
Firefox, too.

## Rationale

[It is said][1] that, for optimum readability, text line length should be
around 12 words per line.  This allows the eye to easily track from the
end of one line to the beginning of the next.

Using Thankful Eyes is better than simply maintaining a minimum font size with
your browser settings because doing that increases the size of many elements
which usually do not require magnification, such as sidebar text, menu items,
small labels, and so on.  Thankful Eyes aims to adjust only body text.
