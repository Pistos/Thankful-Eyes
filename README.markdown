# Thankful Eyes

## About

Thankful Eyes is a bookmarklet which automatically increases the font size of body
text for optimum readability.

## Installation

Copy the whole contents of bookmarklet.js (including the "javascript: "
part at the beginning) and paste into the URL or Address field when creating a
new bookmark in your browser.  For convenience, also put the bookmarklet on a
toolbar.

## Usage

Click your bookmarklet button on any page that has illegibly small body text.

## Notes

You can adjust two variables at the top of the script to control its behaviour.

Thankful Eyes is developed on and for Opera.  It can probably be pretty easily
turned into a Greasemonkey script (for Firefox).
